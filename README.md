# Nintendo DS/DSi/3DS sticker templates
- Tries to provide 1:1 recreations for stickers used on any Nintendo *DS(i) Systems (Maybe more in the future)
- Uses Inkscape's SVG format, allowing for easier access to edit/customize for people who dont want to use/buy Photoshop/Illustrator
- Uses millimeters for measurement allowing for printing to scale

## NOTES:
- Going to experiment with a tool called "Graphite" (graphite.rs) for possible future template development

## Examples:
