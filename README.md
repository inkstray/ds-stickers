# Inkstray's sticker repo
- Attempts to have 1:1 sticker recreations that are able to be edited, featuring stickers from various consoles. Currently only Nintendo DS things are here. Maybe more will be added in the future.
- Stickers were made using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org). I recommend editing the sticker templates using that.

## Note:
- Experimentation is being done with a tool called [Graphite](https://graphite.rs) for possible future template development. Which currently doesn't support mm (millimeter) measuring formats.

## Examples:
